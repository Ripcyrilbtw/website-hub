# website-hub

**his is a futuristic, fully animated central hub website that links to all of your other personal or project websites. It's designed like a digital control center, combining glassmorphism, neon-glow effects, and smooth animations for a visually striking experience.

The layout includes a floating transparent navigation bar, an animated hero landing section with a dynamic background, and a grid of customizable portal cards, each representing a different website. A floating help button is always accessible, guiding users through the experience.

Everything on the page is alive with motion — from animated text and floating icons to scrolling effects and interactive hover states — but the site remains non-interactive in terms of input (no forms, no backend). It's built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, optimized for both desktop and mobile, and designed for easy editing of logos and links.
